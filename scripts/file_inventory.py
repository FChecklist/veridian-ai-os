"""Real, exhaustive file inventory of the canonical VERIDIAN system-of-record (ai-os/ + scripts/),
using MASTER_INDEX.yaml's own exclusion_rules (prune, not -not-path, per its documented speed reason)
so it's fast enough to run on EVERY prompt, not just when something is suspected missing.

Root cause this fixes: files were being discovered reactively (one grep at a time, whenever a
question happened to surface one) instead of via one exhaustive, diffable inventory. This script
IS that inventory. It stores every file's path+size+mtime+hash in a register table and, on every
run, reports what's NEW, CHANGED, or MISSING since the last run -- so "finding a new file" becomes
a printed diff, not an accident three tasks later.

Scope, stated honestly: /opt/veridian/ai-os and /opt/veridian/scripts only (the canonical
system-of-record where every confusion this session happened -- SUPERBOSS_REGISTER.md,
preflight-guard.py, MASTER_INDEX.yaml gaps). Does NOT cover /opt/veridian/repos (application code --
already covered by FUNCTION_CATALOG.json/DATABASE_CATALOG.json/route catalogs, a different existing
mechanism) or /opt/veridian/workspace (ephemeral scratch, explicitly excluded, not system-of-record).
